1. To generate a trajectory to sample initial conditions from (for DA) run the "init_trj_cases" function in control.py.

2. To run DA cases open the DA_cases_input.xlsx file and input the cases you want to run. Then run the "Run_DA_Cases" function in control.py. There are some parameters you can change and you have to specify the paths to the DA_cases_input.xlsx file and to the init_trj that was generated in step 1.

3. Both functions will generate folders where the results are stored.
